Copyocelot

This weekend, I'd like you to copy another website. This time, you'll be really, really good at it!

### Steps

* Start a new repo on GitHub, clone it down with a README, and do an initial commit.
* Pick a website from the following:
	* [youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com)
	* [theatlantic.com](http://www.theatlantic.com)
	* [wsj.com](http://www.wsj.com)
* Copy it, on your own, _committing with every completed div_ (or div-like semantic element!).


### Guidelines

* Seriously, commit with every html sectioning element (div or, preferably, semantic div). We're checking these repos for commits and grading accordingly!
* The other super important guideline is that you use BOTH Flexbox AND Grid. You might be stronger in one than the other, but you need to practice both!
* Go from top to bottom, left to right. You might not finish the entire main page--there's a lot there!--but you should be able to finish most of it this weekend if you take it piece by piece.
* Don't worry about complicated, dynamic sections, like the stocks on the Wall Street Journal, but do copy not just images but videos as well. Use the `<video>` tag. It's a new element to most of you, but it's not that complicated, I pormise.
* For images, copy the image file down to your local repo. Probably not great to save videos, though, just for download time's sake. Just link to the video, and if it goes away for some reason, find a random video online. The content doesn't matter as much as the layout, remember!
* Pay careful attention to spacing your elements. Padding and margin are your friends!
